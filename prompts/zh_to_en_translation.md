<example>
<input>
我们提出了一种新的强化学习策略梯度系列方法，该方法在通过与环境交互采样数据和使用随机梯度上升优化代理目标函数之间交替进行。
</input>

<output>
We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a surrogate objective function using stochastic gradient ascent.
</output>

<explanation>
1. "Policy gradient methods" is the precise technical term used in English reinforcement learning literature.
2. I maintained the parallel structure of "sampling data through interaction with the environment" and "optimizing a surrogate objective function using stochastic gradient ascent" to accurately convey the two alternating steps of the algorithm.
3. The term "surrogate objective function" is the standard way to refer to the optimization target in policy gradient methods.
